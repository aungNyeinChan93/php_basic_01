The filter_input() function in PHP allows you to retrieve a specific external variable by name and optionally
filter it. It’s particularly useful for validating variables from insecure sources, such as user input from forms.
By applying filters, you can prevent potential security threats like SQL injection. Here’s the basic syntax:
filter_input(int $type, string $var_name, int $filter = FILTER_DEFAULT, array|int $options = 0): mixed
type: One of INPUT_GET, INPUT_POST, INPUT_COOKIE, INPUT_SERVER, or INPUT_ENV.
var_name: Name of the variable to retrieve.
filter: The ID of the filter to apply (e.g., FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS).
options: Associative array of options or bitwise disjunction of flags.
For example, you can use filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'search', FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS) to retrieve
and sanitize a search query from the URL query string.
